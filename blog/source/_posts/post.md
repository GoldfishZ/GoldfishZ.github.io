### Football

- Fan of Manchester United
- Usually play as a Striker
- Guangzhou is the most successful team in China

Football is one of my favourite sports and I have been participating in this sport since primary school. Not only do I love to play football, but I also love to watch it and have participated in many football matches. I have put my passion for football into my research and have done two projects related to football and have gained a lot.

### Basketball

- Fan of Los Angeles Lakers
- Fan of LeBron James
- Play as guard usually
- Support China's basketball juggernaut —— Guangdong.

Basketball is a sport I play regularly, and likewise, I was introduced to him in primary schools. Compared to football, basketball requires less court and number of participants, so many times I spend more time playing basketball than football.
